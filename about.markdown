I'm a <b>Creative Technologist and Architect</b> living in Madrid.

I'm currently working and developing tools and strategies for Design Research by focusing my work on scientific and artistic methods. I am interested in collaborating using emerging technologies, data-driven designs, and  installations for creating experiences and finding alternative solutions.

What can you read on the following lines? My background but most importantly, my interests and experiences. I'd be glad to have coffee with you sometime and talk about ideas and opportunities.
