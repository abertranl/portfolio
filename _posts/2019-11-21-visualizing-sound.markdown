<h6> How do you imagine sound? </h6>

<br>

A useless machine for visualizing music: because nowadays it seems like everything is purely visual and also because music makes us feel good. In collaboration with Juanita Pardo, Laura Freixas and Pablo Zuloaga.

<br>

Sound waves make air molecules travel toward and away from the source in high and low pressure. The easiest way to visualize these pressure areas is by picturing waves. Low notes have higher amplitudes and wavelengths and high notes the opposite, smaller amplitudes and wavelengths. It is the superposition of both that make our brain perceive sound. So to picture it and make it real, we decided that small fans were going to e turned on everytime the Arduino recognized a sound. Each with a different set of time to make the fabric move up and down while following the music.
